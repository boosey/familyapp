/**
 * AlbumSurface — the ONE shared album surface (ADR-0009 · #15–#18 · #19).
 *
 * The album is both a full route (`/hub/album`, a deep-link) AND a hub tab (`/hub?tab=album`). Tabs
 * render inline components while a route renders a page, so the surface itself lives here once and is
 * mounted by both: this component renders ONLY the album CONTENT — the grid (or empty note) and the
 * uploader. The page chrome (`<main>`, the container, the back-link, the `<h1>`) belongs to each
 * mount point.
 *
 * Family scope is the hub's SINGLE `?scope=` selector now (Increment 4A) — the album no longer owns
 * its own `?family=` switcher. `scope` is "all" (the deduped union of photos across ALL the viewer's
 * active families) or a family id (only that family's photos). It is re-validated here against the
 * viewer's OWN active families (defense in depth), falling back to "all" — a client-submitted scope
 * is never trusted.
 *
 * All reads go through the album front door: `listActiveFamiliesForPerson` (the viewer's OWN active
 * families), `listAlbumPhotos` (enforces active membership, called per shown family), and
 * `getStewardPersonId`.
