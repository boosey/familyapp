 * the host sets the four R2_* vars and we persist audio to Cloudflare R2 — the Vercel/serverless
 * filesystem is ephemeral, so FilesystemMediaStorage would silently lose every uploaded recording.
 * Anywhere those vars are absent — local dev, CI — we stay on the filesystem store so `pnpm dev`
 * works with no object-store to provision.
 *
 * FAIL LOUD on PARTIAL config: if SOME (but not all four) R2 vars are set, we THROW rather than
 * silently falling back to the ephemeral filesystem store. A half-configured prod deploy is the
 * data-loss trap this whole change exists to prevent — every upload would be lost with zero
 * signal. An immediate boot crash naming the missing vars is the correct, debuggable failure.
 * "Present" means non-blank: a whitespace-only value (e.g. "   ") does NOT count, so it can't
 * sneak a garbage accountId/bucket into the R2 client that would only fail at first network call.
 *
 * CRITICAL — single front door (see CLAUDE.md): the ONLY byte surface is the audited
 * /api/media/[id] route, which runs core authorization then calls `storage.getBytes(key)`.
 * `getUrl` is never called in apps/web. We construct R2MediaStorage WITHOUT a `publicBaseUrl`, so
 * the only URL it could ever produce is a presigned (signed, expiring) one — and even that is
 * never produced, because nothing here calls getUrl. (Filesystem sets publicBaseUrl only to
 * satisfy the MediaStorage interface; that "/media" string is NOT a real route — there is no
 * /media handler, only /api/media/[id] — so if getUrl were ever called it would return a path
 * that does NOT go through the audited route. The safety rests on getUrl being unused.)
