/**
 * Content WRITE path (audited). Together with authorization.ts, this is the only production code
 * permitted to touch the `stories`/`media` tables — keeping every content read AND write in a
 * tiny, reviewable surface.
 *
 * `persistRecordingAndCreateDraft` encodes the spec's capture invariant: the original audio
 * Media is written FIRST (and is immutable thereafter — the DB trigger forbids UPDATE/DELETE),
 * then a `draft` Story is created pointing at it. A draft story is born `private` (it stays
 * there until the narrator approves by voice). The two writes are wrapped in a transaction so a
 * story can never exist without its canonical recording.
 *
 * `updateDerivedFields` and `transitionStoryState` are the pipeline's two narrow write seams:
 * they let transcription/synthesis fill in derived, regenerable fields and advance the lifecycle
 * (always via `assertStoryTransition`), without granting the pipeline raw table access.
 *
 * `getStoryAndRecordingForPipeline` is a tiny system-actor read for orchestration — its only
 * job is to hand the pipeline the storage key + idempotency-relevant story fields. It is NOT a
 * user-facing read; surfacing content to a viewer still goes through @chronicle/core's
 * authorization function. This stays inside the audited allowlist on purpose.

/**
 * Audited core DELETE path for a never-consented draft (ADR-0002).
 *
 * The two "discard" events (explicit narrator discard and re-record supersession) are the ONLY
 * paths that remove rows from the DB — everything else is append-only. This function is the sole
 * entry point for both: callers decide WHEN to invoke it; this function decides WHAT may be
 * deleted and in what ORDER, guaranteeing the invariant "consented audio is immutable forever".
 *
 * Deletion order — story row FIRST, then media row — is required by two constraints acting in
 * concert that the DB enforces independently of this application code:
 *
 *   (a) FK constraint: `stories.recording_media_id → media`. The story row holds the FK
 *       reference; Postgres refuses to delete the media row while any story points at it.
 *       Deleting the story first removes the reference, unlocking the media delete.
 *
 *   (b) The `chronicle_media_delete_guard` trigger (invariants.sql, ADR-0002) checks whether
 *       any story with `recording_media_id = OLD.id` has consent records (via an INNER JOIN
 *       on `consent_records`). With the story row gone, the INNER JOIN returns nothing, and
 *       the trigger permits the delete. If we tried media-first, the FK would RAISE before
 *       the trigger even ran.
 *
 * Why the CALLER deletes the blob (not us): a leaked object-storage blob is harmless — no user
 * can enumerate R2 keys and cost is negligible. A dangling DB row is not harmless: it would
 * confuse authorization, pipeline, and listing queries. The row goes transactionally first;
 * blob cleanup is best-effort after the commit. We return the keys so the caller can do it.
